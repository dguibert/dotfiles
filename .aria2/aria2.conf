# Bit Torrent: If the speed of the incoming data (download) from other peers is
# greater then the peer-speed-limit, then do not allow any more connections
# then max-peers. The idea is to limit the amount of clients our system will
# connect with to reduce our overall load when we are already saturating our
# incoming bandwidth. Make sure to set the the peer-speed-limit to your
# preferred incoming (download) speed. Speeds are in kilobytes per second or
# megebytes per second and must be whole numbers; 5.5M is illegal but 5500K
# and 5M is valid. zero(0) is unlimited peers and unlimited outgoing connections.
bt-max-peers=0
bt-request-peer-speed-limit=0


# Bit Torrent: the max upload speed for all torrents combined. Again, only
# whole numbers are valid. We find a global upload limit is more flexible then
# an upload limit per torrent. Zero(0) is unlimited upload rate.
max-overall-upload-limit=500K


# Bit Torrent: When downloading a torrent remove ALL trackers from the listing.
# This is a good method to only use distributed hash table (DHT) and Peer
# eXchange (PeX) on connections. We find start up of the torrent takes 20
# seconds longer with all trackers disabled, but helps reduce the load on
# trackers.
# bt-exclude-tracker="*"


# Bit Torrent: ports and protocols used for bit torrent TCP and UDP
# connections. Peers use TCP. DHT and PEX as well as UDP based trackers use UDP
# and make sure the DHT server is enabled.

# When running aria2 on FreeBSD with ZFS, disable disk-cache due to ZFS using
# Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC). ZFS can also take advantage of the "sparse
# files" format which is significantly faster then pre allocation of file
# space. For other file systems like EXT4 and XFS you can test with "prealloc"
# and "falloc" to see which file-allocation allows arai2 to start quicker and
# use less disk I/O.
disk-cache=0
file-allocation=none


# Bit Torrent: fully encrypt the negotiation as well and the payload of all bit
# torrent traffic. Encryption is required and all older, non-encrypted clients
# are ignored. This may help avoid some ISPs rate limiting P2P clients, but may
# also reduce the amount of clients aria2 will talk to.

# to save the .torrent file itself. This option works with both magnet and
# torrent URL links.

# Bit Torrent: The amount of time and the upload-to-download ratio you wish to
# seed to. If either the time limit ( seconds ) or the seed ratio is reached,

# Data Integrity: check the MD5 / SHA256 hash of metalink downloads as well as
# the hash of bit torrent chunks as our client receives them. CPU time is

# Disconnect from https, http or ftps server who do not upload data to us

# metalink file which might be quicker. If there are no more mirrors left then
# the current slow mirror is still used. This value is NOT used for bit torrent
# connections though. NOTE: we hope to convince the developer to add a
# lower-speed value or even a minimal client U/D ratio to bit torrent some day
# to kick off leachers too.

# Concurrent downloads: Set the number of different servers to download from
# concurrently; i.e. in parallel. If we are downloading a single file then
# split that file into the same amount of streams. Make sure to keep in mind
# that if the amount of parallel downloads times the lowest-speed-limit is
# greater then your total download bandwidth then you will drop servers
# incorrectly. For example, we have ten(10) connections at a minimum of
# 50KiB/sec which equals 500KiB/sec. If our total download bandwidth is not at
# least 500KiB/sec then arai2 will think the mirrors are too slow and drop
# connection slowing down the whole download. Do not set the
# max-connection-per-server greater then one(1) as to avoid abusing a single
# server.
