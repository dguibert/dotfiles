+            Clients can use this protocol to receive updates of the window manager
+            state (active tags, active layout, and focused window).
+            Clients can also control this state.
+
+            After binding, the client will receive the available tags and layouts
+            with the 'tag' and 'layout' events. These can be used in subsequent
+            dwl_wm_monitor_v1.set_tags/set_layout requests, and to interpret the
+            dwl_wm_monitor_v1.layout/tag events.
